Developed originally in Visual Studio

Description: This is a VERY basic web browser that I built using C#, .NET Framework, and Visual Studio.
I have uploaded only SOME of the source files as it would be very cluttered to upload everything. Functionality
can be tested by downloading and running the executable "JacobBabiksBrowser.exe". The browser and its built-in
features are certainly nothing impressive, however this project was my first experience with C# and the 
.NET Framework. My real goal for this project was to learn the basics of C# and .NET. The game was initially
a web service that I had hosted online in order to work with the .NET Framework for the first time, however I 
later edited it to run locally.
